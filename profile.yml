full_name: Anya Mostowyj
summary: >
  I'm an experienced product engineer, who enjoys creating simple, testable solutions to complex problems. I excel in a 
  collaborative environment; I'm motivated by working side-by-side with people who love what they do, but I'm equally 
  happy working solo and taking ownership of delivering and supporting features in production. Skilled at communicating 
  technical detail to non-technical stakeholders, I am level-headed and decisive, regularly stepping up to take 
  responsibility for technical decisions for my products and then communicating them to the wider team. I love helping to 
  build diverse, collaborative teams and I believe this is the key to delivering real value to the customers and people 
  we're bulding software for.
